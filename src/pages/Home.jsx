        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Savnee, and I am a third year undergraduate student at Columbia University. I am studying financial engineering with a minor in computer science.
          I worked at JPMorganChase last summer as a data engineering intern, and this summer, I will be doing investment banking at UBS.
        </p>
        <p>I am originally from the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia, which has really shaped who I am today. 
          At my core, I am a problem solver, and I really enjoy identifying problems (other people's and my own) and trying to find a way
           to optimize even the most basic things.  My community back home as well as in New York City has made me an avid language enthusiast, a passionate dancer, 
           and a huge country music fan. In my free time, I am usually either playing around with new choreography, exploring coffee shops in the city, or trying my
           hand at writing country music.</p>
